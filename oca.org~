* architecture
** server process
** logical memory: oracle instance
*** instance
**** memory structure
**** background processes
***** user and server processes
usually one server process have only one user process, but some oracle connection configuration allow one server process can have multiple user processes.
****** user process
user process exists in local machine or in middle-tier application and initiate a connection between user to the instance. Once the connection is established, the user established a session in the instance.
****** server process
after established a session, each user starts a server process on the host to operate the database. The server are allowed to interact with the instance, but not the user process directly.
******* PGA(program global area)
a memory structure connection with a server process.
